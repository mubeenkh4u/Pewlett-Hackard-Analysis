## Data Lists:
* All the `CSV files` generated or used for the creation of the Database are located [here.](https://github.com/mubeenkh4u/RBC-Module-7-Employee-Database-with-SQL/tree/main/Data)
* All the `Queries` used for the creation of the Database are located [here.](https://github.com/mubeenkh4u/RBC-Module-7-Employee-Database-with-SQL/tree/main/Queries)
* All the `Images` used for the creation of the Database and Analysis are located [here.](https://github.com/mubeenkh4u/RBC-Module-7-Employee-Database-with-SQL/tree/main/Images)

## Overview:
We kick off this project with the idea of setting up and manipulation of Databases for a company namely "Pewlett-Hackard".

## Purpose:
During our venture of setting up and manipulating the database for the company, we have been tasked with importing some of the company's employee records and relating information.
Using this information we worked towards figuring out how many of the employees at "Pewlett-Hackard" would be retiring and possibly fore-seeing the so called "Silver Tsunami".

## Results:
* Firstly, more than `70,000` employees (after removing duplicates) are retiring which is a significant amount considering the company has approximately `300,000` employees.

* Secondly, we see that a lot of the upcoming retirees would be holding senior positions. This is to be expected from the image depicted below.

* Thirdly, we noticed that the number of potential new mentors is quite limited as well as we can see here.

* Lastly, we can see that most of the mentors are from the 1990s who have enough experience.

## Summary
In summary we can see that the company will lose a lot of employees during the retirement process, which is an approximate `23%` of its current employees.
Also, looking at the current number of avaiable mentors it seems that the company will be in a bit of peril since they won't be enough to train the current (possibly expanding) list of employees.

## Suggestions:
* Queries for creating a breakdown of mentors based on their titles and their departments.
* Queries for creating a breakdown of employees based on their employed time, to further add to the list of possible mentors.
